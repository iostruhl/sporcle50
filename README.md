## This is Sporcle50
While originally intended for CS50 TFs to upload photos of students in their sections to help memorization, anyone can use this as a tool to memorize a small group of names and faces.

# Instructions
1. Create an account with an email/password
2. Download (or curate) your own database of photos
  - Every photo must be of the form FIRST-LAST.jpg (currently)
3. Select all photos to upload
4. Play the game!

# TODO
- Latency is currently crap. At least add a loading image
- Keep track of scores cross session (trivial with Firebase)
- UI/UX?
- Ranking system (amonst TFs at least to start)?
